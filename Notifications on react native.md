# Notifications on react native

We can implement FCM push notifications on a react native app by using this library.

## React Native Firebase
https://rnfirebase.io/messaging/notifications

This will require us to create fcm token for each user which must be saved in the backend to send the notification to the appripriate user.

As we have additional functionality like cancelling a notification we should also use another library in parallel with React Native Firebase.

## Notifee
https://notifee.app

A feature rich notifications library for React Native which allows more control over notifications on a react native app.
